	"prompt": "The SONET problem is a network design problem: set up a network between $n$ nodes, where only certain nodes require a connection. Nodes are connected by putting them on a ring, where all nodes on a ring can communicate. Putting a node on a ring requires a so-called ADM, and each ring has a capacity of nodes, i.e. ADMs. There is a certain amount of rings, $r$, that is available. Given the amount of rings $r$, amount of nodes $n$, the 'demand' (which nodes require communication) and node-capacity of each ring ('capacity_nodes'). The objective is to set up a network by using a minimal amount of ADMs.",
