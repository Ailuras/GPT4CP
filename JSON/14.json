    "prompt": "Given a set of ships, consisting of one battleship (occupying a 4x1 grid), two cruisers (occupying a 3x1 grid), three destroyers (occupying a 2x1 grid), and four submarines (occupying a 1x1 grid). These ships can be placed horizontally or vertically and no two ships can occupy adjacent grids, even diagonally. These ships need to be placed in a 10x10 grid, where each row and column has a value to indicate how many grids need to be occupied. The problem also provides information on some prohibited grid locations, the positions of the submarines, and the positions of the head and tail of the battleship. The goal is to find a solution for placing these ships in the grid.",
