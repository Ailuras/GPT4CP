The graceful graphs problem is: A labelling $f$ of the nodes of a graph with $q$ edges is graceful if $f$ assigns each node a unique label from 0,1,...,q and when each edge $xy$ is labelled with $|f(x)?f(y)|$, the edge labels are all different. Gallian surveys graceful graphs, i.e. graphs with a graceful labelling, and lists the graphs whose status is known. Model the graceful graphs problem using the Python API of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
