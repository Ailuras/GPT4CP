The n-queens problem is: In chess a queen attacks other squares on the same row, column, or either diagonal as itself. So the n-queens problem is to find a set of $n$ locations on a chessboard, no two of which are on the same row, column or diagonal. Model the n-queens problem using the Python API of OR-Tools. Please only output the code, without any prompt or explanation.
