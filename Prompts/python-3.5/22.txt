The Bus Driver Scheduling problem is: Given a set of tasks and a collection of shifts, where each shift is a subset of the tasks. Choose a set of shifts that covers each task exactly once. The goal is to minimize the number of selected shifts. Model the Bus Driver Scheduling problem using the Python API of OR-Tools. Please only output the code, without any prompt or explanation.
