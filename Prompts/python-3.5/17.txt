The Ramsey Numbers problem is: Given a complete graph with n nodes using at most k colours, colour the edges of graph. The goal is to make sure there is no monochromatic triangle in the graph, i.e. in any triangle at most two edges have the same colour. Model the Ramsey Numbers problem using the Python API of OR-Tools. Please only output the code, without any prompt or explanation.
