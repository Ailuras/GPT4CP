The tank allocation problem is: Place cargos into tanks on a chemical tanker(vessel). At most one cargo per tank but several tanks can be used to all the volume of one cargo. Some cargo cannot be placed into adjacent tanks. Some cargo cannot be placed into some tanks. Given all the cargos and the volume to be placed for each them, the pair of cargos that cannot be placed to adjacent tanks, and all the tanks with for each of them it's capacity, location on the vessel, the cargo that cannot be placed inside and the adjacent tanks. The objective is to place all the volumes while satisfying the above constraints and maximizing the total volume of unused space. Model the tank allocation problem using the Python API of OR-Tools. Please only output the code, without any prompt or explanation.
