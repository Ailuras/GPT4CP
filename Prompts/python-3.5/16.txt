The Traffic Lights problem is: Consider a four way traffic junction with eight traffic lights. Four of the traffic lights are for the vehicles and can be represented by the variables V1 to V4 with domains {r,ry,g,y} (for red, red-yellow, green and yellow). The other four traffic lights are for the pedestrians and can be represented by the variables P1 to P4 with domains {r,g}. The constraints on these variables can be modelled by quaternary constraints on (Vi, Pi, Vj, Pj ) for 1≤i≤4,j=(1+i) mod 4 which allow just the tuples {(r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r)}. The goal is to find the colors for each traffic light that satisfy the constraints. Model the Traffic Lights problem using the Python API of CP-SAT solver of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
