The Magic Hexagon problem is: Given a magic hexagon consists of the numbers 1 to 19 arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The arrangement of the elements is [[A,B,C], [D,E,F,G], [H, I, J, K, L], [M, N, O, P], [Q, R, S]]. We want to make the sum of the elements in each diagonal equal to 38. For example, A+B+C=38, A+D+H=38, and so on. Find the possible arrangements of the numbers. Model the Magic Hexagon problem using the Python API of CP-SAT solver of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
