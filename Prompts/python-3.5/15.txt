The Schur's Lemma problem is: Given n balls labeled $1,..., n$. The goal is to put these balls into 3 boxes so that for any triple of balls $(x,y,z)$ with $x+y=z$, not all are in the same box. Model the Schur's Lemma problem using the Python API of CP-SAT solver of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
