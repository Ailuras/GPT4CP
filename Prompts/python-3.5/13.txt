The Progressive Party Problem problem is: Given some boats, certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive periods. The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts. Every boat can only hold a limited number of people at a time (its capacity) and crew sizes are different. The total number of people aboard a boat, including the host crew and guest crews, must not exceed the capacity. A table with boat capacities and crew sizes can be found below; there were six time periods. A guest boat cannot not revisit a host and guest crews cannot meet more than once. The goal is to minimize the number of host boats. Model the Progressive Party Problem problem using the Python API of CP-SAT solver of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
