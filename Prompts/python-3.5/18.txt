The Water Bucket Problem problem is: Given an 8 pint bucket of water, and two empty buckets which can contain 5 and 3 pints respectively. You are required to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket). This goal is to get the minimum number of transfers of water between buckets. Model the Water Bucket Problem problem using the Python API of CP-SAT solver of OR-Tools. Please only output the code in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
