The n-queens problem is: In chess a queen attacks other squares on the same row, column, or either diagonal as itself. So the n-queens problem is to find a set of $n$ locations on a chessboard, no two of which are on the same row, column or diagonal. Build a MiniZinc model for the n-queens problem. Please only output the model in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
