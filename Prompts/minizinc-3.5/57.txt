The killer sudoku problem is: Killer Sudoku is a puzzle played on a {9*9} grid containing 81 cells. The cells are filled in with numbers from the set {1,..,9}. Each row and column must contain all numbers {1,..,9}. Each of the 9 non-overlapping 3*3 subsquares (named boxes) must also contain all numbers {1,..,9}. Each Killer Sudoku puzzle has a set of cages. A cage is a set of contiguous cells and a total; the numbers in the cells must add up to the total. Also, the cells in a cage cannot contain the same number more than once. The cages do not overlap, and they cover all cells. Cages typically contain two to four cells. Build a MiniZinc model for the killer sudoku problem.
