The Bus Driver Scheduling problem is: Given a set of tasks and a collection of shifts, where each shift is a subset of the tasks. Choose a set of shifts that covers each task exactly once. The goal is to minimize the number of selected shifts. Build a MiniZinc model for the Bus Driver Scheduling problem. Please only output the model in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
