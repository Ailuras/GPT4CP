The Schur's Lemma problem is: Given n balls labeled $1,..., n$. The goal is to put these balls into 3 boxes so that for any triple of balls $(x,y,z)$ with $x+y=z$, not all are in the same box. Build a MiniZinc model for the Schur's Lemma problem. Please only output the model in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
