The Crossfigures problem is: Given an array: [[1, 2, _, 3, X, 4, _, 5, 6], [7, _, X, 8, _, , X, 9, ], [, X, 10, _, X, 11, 12, X, _], [13, 14, _, _, X, 15, _, 16, _], [X, _, X, X, X, X, X, _, X], [17, _, 18, 19, X, 24, _, X, ], [, X, 23, _, X, 24, _, X, _], [25, 26, X, 27, _, _, X, 28, _], [29, _, _, _, X, 30, _, _, _]]. In this array, each non-"X" grid should be filled with an integer from 0 to 9. The numbers represent grid indexes, not values. We use the index to represent a number starting from this grid until the next "X". If both horizontally and vertically arranged numbers start at index i, we use i across and i down to represent them respectively. For example, 1 down represents the number formed by the grids with indexes 1, 7, _, and 13. If the numbers in these four grids are 1, 6, 3, and 5, then 1 down represents 1635. We are given the following clues: 1 across = 27 across plus twenty-seven; 4 across = 4 down plus seventy-one; 28 across = Four dozen; 29 across = Seven gross. The goal is to assign values to each non-"X" grid while satisfying the given clues. Build a MiniZinc model for the Crossfigures problem. Please only output the model in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
