The Water Bucket Problem problem is: Given an 8 pint bucket of water, and two empty buckets which can contain 5 and 3 pints respectively. You are required to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket). This goal is to get the minimum number of transfers of water between buckets. Build a MiniZinc model for the Water Bucket Problem problem. Please only output the model in the format of code block, without any prompt or explanation.
